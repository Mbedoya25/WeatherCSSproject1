#Weather Alert

This project is a simple Flask web application that shows real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app includes a dark theme, clear text styling, and warning messages for extreme weather conditions.

#Overview

The user enters a city, and the app displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short weather description. It also gives warnings when the temperature is extremely hot or cold, when wind speeds are high, or when storms are detected.

#Structure

The project contains a Flask backend, two HTML templates, and a CSS file for the dark theme. The template folder holds the search page and the results page, and the static folder holds the styling.

#Setup

To run the app, clone the repository, install Flask and Requests, add your API key in the Python file, and start the server with `python app.py`. The app will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

#Styling

The CSS file provides a dark theme with dark red numbers, dark blue text, and a clean layout for the weather information.

#what was used 

The project uses Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, the OpenWeatherMap API, and GitHub for version control.
